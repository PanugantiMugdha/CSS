# Grid Model

The **Grid Model** consists of three main parts:

1. **Grid Lines**  
   - These are the **row lines** and **column lines** that define the structure of the grid.  

2. **Grid Cells**  
   - Formed by the intersection of row and column lines.  
   - Usually **square-shaped**.  

3. **Grid Tracks**  
   - The space **between two row lines** or **two column lines**.
